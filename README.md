## Bugs

### Solved bugs

- During the development process, I encountered an issue with integrating Google Fonts into the project within Visual Studio Code. Despite implementing the appropriate syntax, the fonts failed to render correctly. Upon troubleshooting, I discovered that enclosing the font names within quotation marks resolved the issue. This adjustment ensured proper integration of Google Fonts, allowing for consistent and appealing typography throughout the website.

- One challenge encountered during development was related to the resolution of images used on the website. The high resolution of these images negatively impacted the performance score in Lighthouse tests. To address this issue, I resized and optimized the images, reducing their file size without compromising on quality. This optimization resulted in improved website performance, ensuring faster loading times and a better user experience overall.

### Unfixed Bugs

- No unfixed bugs.


## Validator Testing

### HTML

- No errors were returned when passing through the officia W3C

### CSS

- No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.

### Accessibility

- I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running lighthouse in DevTools.

## Content

- The Culinary Classroom Website is inspired by the challenge presented in the Love Running project. As someone new to coding without prior experience, embarking on this project was both challenging and immensely rewarding. It served as a significant milestone in my coding journey, allowing me to apply newfound knowledge and skills in a practical context. Through this project, I aimed to create a user-friendly platform for culinary education, leveraging the principles and techniques learned during the Love Running challenge.
